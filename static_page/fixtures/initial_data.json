Most of the information you provide us is information you authorize to become public. This includes not only your posts and the subsequent metadata provided with posting, such as when you created a post, but also the lists you create, the people you follow, and many other bits of information that result from your use of the Services. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide public for as long as you do not delete it from Thefamdates profile and/or account, but we generally give you settings to make the information more private if you want. Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For instance, your public user profile information and information included within may be searchable by search engines and are immediately delivered via SMS and our APIs to a wide range of users and services. When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should think carefully about the content and information you are making public.</p>\r\n \r\n<h4>Location Information</h4>\r\n<p>You may choose to publish your location in your posts and in your Thefamdates profile. You may also tell us your location when you set your trend location on Thefamdates or enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information.

We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>\r\n            \r\n            \r\n</div> <!--/span11-->\r\n \r\n            \r\n            </div>",
